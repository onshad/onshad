My main area of research includes bioinformatics, cancer transcriptome, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning. I finished Ph.D. in Tongji University, Shanghai, China, and received 2019-2020 Doctoral Dissertation Award (Association for computing machinery, China Council, Shanghai Chapter). Then I worked as postdoctoral fellow in University Health Network, Toronto, Canada (2020-now) and Third Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University (2019-2022). I have published 6 first/co-first authorship papers in journals such as Nature Cell Biology, Nucleic Acids Research, and Plant Physiology (Details at https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1495-4238).
